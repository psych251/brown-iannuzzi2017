## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

####Load Relevant Libraries and Functions
library(tidyverse)
library(knitr)

####Import data
padata <- read.csv("PilotAData.csv")
View(padata)
padata <- padata %>% 
  select(starts_with("W"),
         starts_with("NW"))
padata <- padata %>%

padata <- padata %>%
  filter(W_White == 1 | W_White == 2) %>% 
  mutate(pID = row_number())

#### Data exclusion / filtering
#There are no exclusion criteria.

#### Prepare data for analysis - create columns etc.
padata_long <- padata %>%
  gather(measure, rating, W_White:NW_CashS)
View(padata_long)
padata_long$rating <- as.numeric(padata_long$rating)
padata_long <- padata_long %>%
  separate(measure, 
           c("image", "measure"))

padata_spread <- padata_long %>%
  spread(measure, rating)

#### Plot means
padata_means <- padata_spread %>%
